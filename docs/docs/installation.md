## Composer (recommended)

*Does require ProcessWire 2.8+*  
Run the following command in the root of your project and install the module via the backend after that:

```
:::bash
composer require lostkobrakai/migrations
```

Adding the module via composer has the benefit, that all dependencies (CLI) are automatically installed as well.

If you don't have composer installed, have a look here on how to get it: [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

## Modules Directory

1. Log in to your ProcessWire admin and go to the Modules page.
2. Go to the New tab and expand the Add Module From Directory section.
3. Enter the Module Class Name: Migrations
4. Click the Download and Install button.
